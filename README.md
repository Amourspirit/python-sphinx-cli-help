# Sphinx CLI Help

## Introduction

This project converts the `objects.inv` created by [Sphinx Docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) into a command line interface that allows for quick searching and launching the online help from the command line.

This project is designed as a template.
Using this template for your own project means you can create and publish CLI package for any Sphinx project with very little configuration and No coding necessary.

## Getting Started

Create your own project by click the `Use this template` on GitHub.
